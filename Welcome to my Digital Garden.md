# The Concept

I saw online someone sharing just random notes from their Obsidian and I thought I would do the same. It might be useful for someone like you out there looking for random information. This digital garden is not going to be structured in anyway (maybe losely structured) and will be somewhat of a stream of consiousness. Some notes may be complete, some incomplete. It's all a work in progress. Much like an actual garden.

## What notes are in here?

I am just starting this digital garden today. I guess its kind of like a blog? It will probably be mostly eurorack circuits. bits of that. probably some code for some stuff I am working on. I am getting really into plugin development again. I was into it about 10 years ago or so but life is a bit different now and I find myself working on my computer more and more. 
## What else?

Other notes will probably be more like random things I find intereting. Mainly technology or screenshots of random things. I've compiled a huge list of useful AI websites. That might be good to throw up here.
